Open you'r command prompt then type the command bellow in you'r project folder :
```sh
php index.php welcome index
```

#### :arrow_right: Test the App
Open three pages of your project on following url with different IDs :
`http://localhost/myproject/user/index/1`
`http://localhost/myproject/user/index/2`

:heavy_exclamation_mark: In my example, **recipient_id** is defined by **user_id**, as you can see, it's the **auth callback** who defines recipient ids.

If you have something like that, everything is ok for you:
